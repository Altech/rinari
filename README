Well, ok it kind of is. Rinari is a set of Emacs Lisp modes that is
aimed towards making Emacs into a top-notch Ruby and Rails development
environment.

Copy the directory containing this file into your Emacs lisp
directory, assumed here to be ~/.emacs.d. Add these lines of code to
your .emacs file:

  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/rinari")
  (require 'rinari)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-M-f") 'find-file-in-project) ;; optional

To make and install the info documentation cd into the doc/ directory
and run makeinfo to make the .info documentation then run install-info
as the super user.

cd doc/
makeinfo rinari.texi
sudo install-info rinari.info

To make an html version of the documentation cd into the documentation
directory and run makeinfo -- html

cd doc/
makeinfo --html rinari.texi

Copies of ruby-mode.el, inf-ruby.el, and other dependencies have been
included for convienience (also inf-ruby.el and ruby-mode.el contain
minor fixes not yet in the official version). Nxhtml-mode is not
included because it's rather large, so you should download it
independently[1].

One possible .init file for nxhtml in rinari would be

;;; nxml (HTML ERB template support)
(load "~/.emacs.d/nxml/autostart.el")

(setq
 nxhtml-global-minor-mode t
 mumamo-chunk-coloring 'submode-colored
 nxhtml-skip-welcome t
 indent-region-mode t
 rng-nxml-auto-validate-flag nil
 nxml-degraded t)

While ido-mode[2] is not strictly required it is very helpfull in
combination with many of Rinari functions.  For more information about
enabling ido-mode see the link below, or to just go ahead and try it out add

;; Interactively Do Things
(require 'ido)
(ido-mode t)

to your emacs init file.
