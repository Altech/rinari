= Rinari Is Not A Ruby IDE.
  http://rinari.rubyforge.org

Well, ok it kind of is. Rinari is a set of Emacs Lisp modes that is
aimed towards making Emacs into a top-notch Ruby and Rails
development environment.

Copy the directory containing this file into your Emacs lisp
directory, assumed here to be ~/.emacs.d. Add these lines of code
to your .emacs file:

  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/rinari")
  (require 'rinari)

Copies of ruby-mode.el, inf-ruby.el, and other dependencies have been
included for convienience, but may be out of date. Nxhtml-mode is not
included because it's rather large, so you should download it here:
