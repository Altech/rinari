= Rinari Is Not A Ruby IDE.
  http://rinari.rubyforge.org

Well, ok it kind of is. Rinari is a set of Emacs Lisp modes that is
aimed towards making Emacs into a top-notch Ruby and Rails
development environment.

Copy the directory containing this file into your Emacs lisp
directory, assumed here to be ~/.emacs.d. Add these lines of code
to your .emacs file:

  (add-to-list 'load-path "~/.emacs.d/rinari")
  (require 'rinari)
  (global-set-key (kbd "C-x C-M-f") 'find-file-in-project)

Copies of ruby-mode.el, inf-ruby.el, and other dependencies have been
included for convienience, but may be out of date. Nxhtml-mode is not
included because it's rather large, so you should download it here:

  http://ourcomments.org/Emacs/nXhtml/doc/nxhtml.html

One possible .init file for nxhtml in rinari would be

;;; nxml (rhtml support)
(load "~/.emacs.d/nxml/autostart.el")

(setq
 nxhtml-global-minor-mode t
 mumamo-chunk-coloring 'submode-colored
 nxhtml-skip-welcome t
 indent-region-mode t
 rng-nxml-auto-validate-flag nil
 nxml-degraded t
 )
